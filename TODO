Known Issues/Problems
- lot's of confusion on mixed use of strings like '0F' and ints like '15'
- tested with linux only
- the cool, polyglott config-file format exposes both client and server toward
    a command execution vulnerability if a local attacker has write-access.
- utilizing the timestamp for authentication requires us to have synchronous
     time on client and server.
- hash-strength is limited and possibly bad.
    when using ping, we are limited to 17bytes worth of information.
    Idea 0: use 1 byte less and transmit substr(hash,byte). <- meh
    Idea 1: randomize substring-slicing of hash and take e.g. lowest tstamp byte
             as input
