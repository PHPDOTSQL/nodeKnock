Security Considerations

Although I am quite convinced that this tool does what it's supposed to do I
must admit, that I have never looked at any other port knocking tool's code and
may have made some blatantly stupid mistakes.
It's also important to know that a local attacker with write permissions on the
config will be able to execute arbitrary commands as the user running the
client/server reading the specific file.
A world-readable config file will leak your secret.

For other known weaknesses and issues see TODO.
